# Guelph Transit Map

A simple web app to view bus locations, routes, and stops for the Guelph Transit Commission. Available for use at [guelph-transit-map.ca](https://guelph-transit-map.ca)

## Description

I was tired of standing at a bus stop and wondering where my bus was, as buses in Guelph are often running late. I discovered that Guelph provides access to real time GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data through their [open data portal](http://data.open.guelph.ca/group/transportation). Knowing this, and with an interest in doing fun things with publicly available data, I set out to display the locations of all the buses on a simple map. I later added the ability to view a buses route outline. My friend [Michael](https://github.com/mrusse) took an interest and made several great improvements to the app including displaying all the UI controls on the map element itself, the ability to view multiple routes at once, and the ability to view a route's stops.
